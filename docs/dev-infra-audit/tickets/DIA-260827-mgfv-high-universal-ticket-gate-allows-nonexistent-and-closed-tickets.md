## Description

<To be filled at creation time: what is wrong / what to build, with exact
files and line references where known.>

## Verification

<Acceptance criteria as checkboxes - how to prove the ticket is done.>

## Fix

Detail: gate checks filename existence only, never OPEN status; nonexistent valid IDs warn and proceed. Impact: general engineering can start under fabricated or closed tickets.

Fix: fail closed and require an existing OPEN ticket for every task.

## Re-verify

> To be filled at re-verify time.
